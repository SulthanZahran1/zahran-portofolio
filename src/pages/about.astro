	<p>
		Software Engineer specializing in industrial automation and data processing with expertise in AMHS, real-time logistics systems, and large-scale data pipelines. Selected as AMHS specialist for international deployment to integrate production systems for new manufacturing facilities.
	</p>

	<h3>Professional Experience</h3>

	<h4>Smart Factory Integrators/Developers - AMHS</h4>
	<p><em>LG Sinarmas Technology Solutions (Merged from LG CNS Indonesia) | Karawang, Indonesia | Apr 2024 - Present</em></p>
	<h5>International Deployment - System Integration Specialist</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Selected as 1 of 4 engineers for 2-month deployment to South Korea to lead AMHS subsystem integration and testing for two new production facilities in LG ENSOL Ochang Factory.</li>
		<li>Conducted comprehensive integration testing of AMHS-AGV systems (OpenTCS-based architecture) connecting real-time dispatch, material control systems, and conveyor infrastructure</li>
		<li>Proactively identified and resolved 15+ potential integration issues during testing phase, preventing production delays</li>
		<li>Delivered comprehensive technical training and documentation to local engineering team</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Core Systems Development</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Develop and optimize logistics algorithms for AMHS managing thousands of concurrent material movements across 8 production lines in 24/7 battery manufacturing operations in Hyundai LG Indonesia Factory</li>
		<li>Engineered production-critical diagnostic tools (Python/SQL) including a <strong>Timing Diagram Analyzer</strong> that processes 100MB+ log files for rapid incident analysis, reducing diagnosis time from hours to minutes</li>
		<li>Built version control and static analysis suite improving development workflow and code quality for 10+ member engineering team</li>
		<li>Maintain and enhance RTD (Real-Time Dispatch) logic, directly impacting production throughput and material flow efficiency</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Research Assistant, FAAN Laboratory</h4>
	<p><em>Universitas Indonesia | Jakarta, Indonesia | Oct 2023 - Mar 2024</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Developed real-time spectroscopic data analysis application using MATLAB App Designer</li>
		<li>Implemented signal processing algorithms for advanced spectral analysis and automated curve fitting</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Selected Projects</h3>

	<h4>Timing Diagram Analyzer</h4>
	<p><em>Python, SQL, Log Processing</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Production-critical diagnostic tool that processes 100MB+ log files for rapid AMHS incident analysis, enabling diagnosis in minutes versus days of manual analysis</li>
		<li>Implements advanced filtering and interval analysis algorithms for complex timing relationships in distributed systems</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>SEC Financial Data Extraction Pipeline</h4>
	<p><em>Python, Gemini Flash 2.0 API</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Built end-to-end pipeline automating extraction of structured financial data from 500+ SEC documents (75,000+ total pages) for academic research</li>
		<li>Integrated web scraping, LLM-powered parsing, and structured output validation, reducing months of manual work to overnight batch processing</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>BMKG Sensor Network Monitoring System</h4>
	<p><em>Flask, React, Geospatial Visualization</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Real-time monitoring system with map-based visualization for Indonesian meteorological agency (BMKG) displaying sensor status across geographic regions</li>
		<li>Deployed for operational use enabling rapid identification of sensor failures and network health assessment through geographic awareness</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Other Projects</h3>

	<h4>SQL Query Dependency Visualizer</h4>
	<p><em>Python, SQL Parsing, AST Analysis, Graph Visualization, CTE Analysis</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Built a SQL parser that analyzes CTE relationships and generates clear dependency graphs. The tool parses SQL queries into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), identifies all CTE definitions and references, and constructs a directed graph showing how tables flow through the query logic.</li>
		<li>Makes complex query structure immediately understandable. Reduced time spent understanding legacy queries and enabled faster, more confident query refactoring. Particularly valuable for onboarding new team members to complex analytical codebases.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Spectroscopy Analysis & Autofitting Tool</h4>
	<p><em>MATLAB, Scientific Computing, Data Analysis, Curve Fitting</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Developed a MATLAB-based tool for automated analysis of spectroscopy data. The application performs automatic curve fitting to spectroscopy results and calculates important physics constants, significantly reducing manual analysis time for lab research workflows.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Temperature Sensor Signal Filter</h4>
	<p><em>Digital Signal Processing</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Developed a digital filter to improve raw temperature sensor readings by reducing noise and smoothing signal fluctuations. The filter enhances data quality for downstream analysis while maintaining signal responsiveness to actual temperature changes.</li>
	</ul>
